"But in the course of my wanderings I had the good fortune to save the ninth life of a tailorâ€”tailors having, like cats, nine lives, as you probably know. The fellow was exceedingly grateful, for had he lost that ninth life it would have been the end of him; so he begged permission to furnish me with the stylish costume I now wear. It fits very nicely, does it not?" and the Woggle-Bug stood up and turned himself around slowly, that all might examine his person.</p><p>"He must have been a good tailor," said the Scarecrow, somewhat enviously.</p><p>"He was a good-hearted tailor, at any rate," observed Nick Chopper.</p></div> </div>
